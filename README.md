whatsapp_recentcontacts_python


Add these two files in same folder and run the python code after you scan the QR code (to login in whatsapp) you can see your recent contact list in the terminal. Few points to note:

1- You must be using python3 to run the code

2- Google chrome and chrome driver version must be same. I have Google chrome of Version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit) so I downloaded chrome driver accordingly.

3- You can download another version of chrome driver from the link - http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads

4- I built this code to leverage Google Chrome driver.

5- You must have dowloaded Selenium as well. You can use the command - `pip3 install selenium` to download selenium

6- You must have dowloaded the webdriver manager. Use command - `pip3 install webdriver-manager` to download this. If you still face any issues then you can comment on https://blog.learningdollars.com/2019/05/27/how-to-print-your-whatsapp-recent-contacts-using-python-selenium-and-web-driver/
